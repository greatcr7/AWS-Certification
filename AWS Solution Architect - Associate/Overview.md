# The Bible: AWS Well Architected Framework
This is THE most important official guide to the exam, or any AWS certification exam really. Study this inside out.

# Five Pillars
## Operational Excellence
The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually imrpove supporting processes and procedures.
## Security

The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technology evolve.
## Cost Optimization
The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

# General Design Principles
Stop guessing your capacity needs.
Test systems at production scale.
Automate to make architectural experimentation easier.
Allow for evolutionary architectures.
Drive architectures using data.
Improve through game days.
