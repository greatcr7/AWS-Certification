# The Bible: AWS Well Architected Framework
This is THE most important official guide to the exam, or any AWS certification exam really. Study this inside out.

# Five Pillars
## Operational Excellence
The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually imrpove supporting processes and procedures.
### Design Principles for Operational Excellence (6 in total)
- Perform operaiotns as code.
- Annotate documentation.
- Make frequent, small, reversible changes.
- Refine operations procedures frequently.
- Anticipate failure.
- Learn from all operational failures.
## Security
The ability to protect information, system, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. 
## Reliability
The ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.
## Performance Efficiency
The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technology evolve.
## Cost Optimization
The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

# General Design Principles
- Stop guessing your capacity needs.
- Test systems at production scale.
- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier.
- Allow for evolutionary architectures.
- Drive architectures using data.
- Improve through game days.
