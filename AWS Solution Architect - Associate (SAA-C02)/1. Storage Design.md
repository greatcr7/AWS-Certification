# 1. Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
## Storage Services
- Always use *SSD*, not HDD, if you are performance conscious.
- New units: Decibel vs Binary terminologies. gibibyte != A gigabyte
- KiB = 1024 bytes = 2^10 bytes. KB = 1000 bytes = 10^3 bytes. MiB = 2^20 bytes. MB = 10^6 bytes. etc. 
- Availability: when you access the file, it will be there.
- Durability: file exists somewhere on AWS.
- S3 always has 11-9 durability. Availability of different S3 storage classes, however, changes.
## S3 Storage Class
- Most objects in S3 distributes across at least ***three availability zones (AZs)***.
- Storage class ***1A*** is only in one availability zone. Less recoverable, yet cheap.
- S3 supports encryption and automatic data classification.
- S3 supports analytics inside buckets directly.
- Ways to get data into S3: API, Amazon Direct Connect, Storage Gateway, Kinesis Firehose (large amount of data), Transfer Acceleration (needs CloudFront, when you need to upload data elsewhere across the globe, expensive), Snow Family (physical storage, if your data uploaded through Internet could take huge amount of time).
