# 1. Compute Services Design
## Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Overview
- EC2 is a virtualmachineinthecloud: software emulating computer.
- EC2 benefits: Time to market, scalability, reliability, security.
- EC2 Deployment: Select an Amazon Machine Image/AMI -> Configure networking and security -> Choose an instance type -> Choose the Availability Zone -> Attach storage -> Start the instance.
## EC2 Instance Types
- 
## EC2 Pricing
## Elastic Block Store (EBS) and EC2
- To use EBS, an EBS-optimized instance should be deployed.
- PIOPS EBS is linked to certain types of EC2 instances. In order to use higher PIOPS EBS, you have to select pricier EC2 instances.
